These are the IMDB DiffTools 2.5 for OS/2 and eComStation. See Readme.txt for
documentation and license information, or type 'ApplyDiffs' or 'CheckCRC' at a
command line for a short help.
 
The tools were built with gcc 2.8.1 from EMX 0.9d fix 4. To be able to run the
executables, you MUST have the EMX 0.9d fix 4 Unix compatibility extensions
installed, which are available from any major OS/2 software archive. See
 
http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-browse?sh=1&dir=/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d or
http://www.os2ports.com/pub/os2/unix/devtools/emx-gcc/v0.9d/
 
End-users only need to obtain the EMX runtime package emxrt.zip from one of the
above directories.
